# Go-solc-select [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fabelx/go-solc-select?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fabelx/go-solc-select)

The work is inspired by the **[Solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select)** tool for managing and switching
between versions of the **Solidity** compiler, which I actively use in my work.
However, what has a significant disadvantage for me is the dependence
on **Python** or the need to use **Docker** as an isolating environment.

# About

`Go-solc-select` - is a simple program that installs the **Solidity** compiler
and switches between them. This can be a useful tool for managing
different versions of the **Solidity** compiler, checking available versions
for a particular operating system. It is designed to be easy to install
and use.

The tool is split into two CLI utilities:
- `gsolc-select`: manages installing and setting different `solc` compiler versions
- `solc`: wrapper around `solc` which picks the right version according to what was set via `gsolc-select`

The `solc` binaries are downloaded from https://binaries.soliditylang.org/ which contains
official artifacts for many historial and modern `solc` versions for Linux and macOS.

The downloaded binaries are stored in `~/.gsolc-select/artifacts/`.

# Platforms

`Go-solc-select` is designed for use on Unix/Linux/POSIX systems as a command line tool.

# Installation

`Go-solc-select` requires **go1.17** to install successfully. Run the command below
to install the latest version.

To install `gsolc-select`:
```shell
go install -v github.com/fabelx/go-solc-select/cmd/gsolc-select@latest
```

To install `solc` wrapper:
```shell
go install -v github.com/fabelx/go-solc-select/cmd/solc@latest
```

# Usage

```shell
gsolc-select --help
```

This will display help for the `gsolc-select`.

```yaml
gsolc-select

  Allows users to installer and quickly switch between Solidity compiler versions

Usage:
  gsolc-select [command]

Examples:
  gsolc-select versions current - get current solc version
  gsolc-select install 0.8.1 - install a solc compiler
  gsolc-select use 0.8.1 - switch current version to 0.8.1
  gsolc-select uninstall 0.8.1 - remove solc compiler
  gsolc-select uninstall 0.8.1 0.8.17 -v - remove solc compilers verbose
  gsolc-select versions - get installed solc compiler versions
  gsolc-select versions installable - get installable solc compiler versions for current platform (OS)


Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  install     Install available solc versions
  uninstall   Remove installed solc versions
  use         Change the version of global solc compiler
  versions    Installed solc versions

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for gsolc-select
  -j, --json      indicate if you want to use json format for logging details
  -s, --verbose   indicate if you want for log details
  -v, --version   version for gsolc-select

  Use "gsolc-select [command] --help" for more information about a command.

# Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/fabelx/go-solc-select/pkg/installer"
	"github.com/fabelx/go-solc-select/pkg/uninstaller"
	"github.com/fabelx/go-solc-select/pkg/versions"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
)

func main() {
	// Get available versions
	available, err := versions.GetAvailable()
	if err != nil {
		return
	}

	var versionsToInstall []string
	for key, _ := range available { 
		versionsToInstall = append(versionsToInstall, key)
	}

	// Setup context
	ctx, stop := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGINT)
	defer stop()

	// Install all available versions 
	i, _, err := installer.InstallSolcs(ctx, versionsToInstall)
	if err != nil {
		return
	}
	
	// Uninstall installed versions
	_, _, err = uninstaller.UninstallSolcs(i)
	if err != nil {
		return 
	}
}
